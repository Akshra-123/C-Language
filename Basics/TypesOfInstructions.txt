valid statement:
int a=1,b;
here we have 

the modulo operator in arithmetic operators in c is applicable only for integer values and not for float

type conversion:
int operator int = int
int operator float = float
float operator float = float

3) Types of Control Statements:
  a) sequence control
  b) decision control
  c) loop control
  d) case control

Precedence of Operators:
1)logical not
2)Arithmetic 
3)Relational
